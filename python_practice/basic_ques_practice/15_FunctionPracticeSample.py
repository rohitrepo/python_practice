#Let us practice functions

#following function does TASK of addition

#declaring the function
def addFunction (a, b):
    result = a + b
    print (result)

#Whenever I want to perform addition, I would not write entire logic. I would just call the functin
#Calling function for the first time
addFunction(2, 3)

#calling function for the second time
addFunction(99, 1002)
